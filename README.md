# Product Performance Dashboard with Power BI | Infosys Springboard Task 3 



## Dataset Overview:
You will use a dataset with the following columns:
- **Product ID**
- **Product Name**
- **Category**
- **Region**
- **Sales Amount**
- **Cost**
- **Profit**
- **Customer Segment**
- **Date**

## Instructions:

### 1. Data Import and Preparation
- Load the dataset into Power BI.
- Create a new calculated column for **Profit Margin** using the following formula:
- Ensure all columns are correctly formatted (e.g., ensure numerical columns like Sales Amount, Cost, and Profit are in number format, and Date is in Date format).

### 2. Visualizations
Create the following visualizations:

#### 2.1 Clustered Column Chart:
- Create a **clustered column chart** showing **Sales Amount by Region**.
- Use **color coding for Profit Margin** to visualize the profitability of each region.
- Apply **conditional formatting** to highlight high and low margins (e.g., use green for high margins and red for low margins).

#### 2.2 Matrix Visualization:
- Create a **matrix** showing the following fields:
- **Product Name**
- **Category**
- **Sales Amount**
- **Profit**
- Ensure that **subtotals** and **grand totals** are included in the matrix for Sales Amount and Profit.

#### 2.3 Card Visual:
- Add a **card visual** that displays the **total Sales Amount** across all products.

### 3. Filters and Slicers
Add the following filters and slicers to allow for advanced analysis:

#### 3.1 Category Slicer:
- Add a **slicer** for **Category** to allow users to filter the data based on product category.

#### 3.2 Date Range Slicer:
- Add a **date range slicer** to filter data based on the selected date range.

#### 3.3 Visual-Level Filter:
- Apply a **visual-level filter** to only show products with a **Profit Margin > 10%**. This will help to focus on the more profitable products.

### 4. Formatting and Customization
- Apply a **color theme** to the dashboard to ensure visual consistency across all visuals.
- Use **data labels** where appropriate to display key values (e.g., sales amounts, profit margins).
- Add a **title** to your dashboard: `"Product Performance Analysis"`.

### 5. Insights
- Add a **text box** summarizing at least 2 insights based on your findings. For example:
- Products with the highest profit margin.
- Regions contributing the most to sales.

## Submission Guidelines:
- Save your Power BI file as `StudentName_ProductPerformance.pbix`.
